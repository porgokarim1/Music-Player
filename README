Music-Player

This is a simple music player application that allows you to play, pause, skip to the next or previous tracks, adjust the volume, and seek to specific positions in the track. The player displays the track name, artist, and album art for the currently playing song. It supports multiple tracks, and you can easily customize the track list by adding or modifying entries in the track_list variable.
